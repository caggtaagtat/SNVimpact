# 5'ss variations

This repository contains code to reproduce the analysis of our paper with the titel: 
### Fully haplotyped genome assemblies of healthy individuals reveal variability in 5â€™ss strength and support by splicing regulatory proteins 

Supplementary Data and data used for the analysis can be accessed via zonodo und DOI: X

First, the large VCF file from the publication was preprocessed into 2 csv tables stating haplotyped sequence variations per individual genome (1_Preprocessing VCF.sh, 2_Create_csv.R)

Next, every identifed sequence variation was introduced into the reference sequence surrounding of 5'ss (3_Introduce_variations.sh), applying 3 custom R scripts (31_Introduce_variations.R, 32_SDvariation.R and 33_GetReferenceSequence.R).

The information of the indiviudal csv-files was then summarized and analyzed with an additional custom R-script (4_Evaluation_5ss_variation.R). All figures of the paper can be generated with the final dataset (Final_data.R) and the custom R-script (5_Figure_generation.R).
